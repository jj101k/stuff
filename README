Makefile.copyme - a makefile template to act as a "git pull" wrapper, such that
                  "make" is equivalent to "git pull && make".
bin/            - directory full of utilities which are useful for my workflow
bin/current-git-dir
                - Prints the full path to the current top of the repository
bin/current-git-branch
                - Quick and dirty current-branch printer
bin/pushto      - Use for maintaining multiple working directories, eg. code,
                  dev (alpha test), test. This helps greatly with separating
                  debugging efforts, and helps avoid embarrassing "it was in my
                  working dir" problems.
